Hi, thanks for visiting! My name is Quan. 

I am currently an AI Resident at [FPT AI Residency](https://wp.fpt-aic.com/ai-residency/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Hoang Thanh-Tung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xZU08d0AAAAJ). My research focuses on exploring alternatives that challenge the dominance of autoregressive Transformers, with a particular emphasis on non-autoregressive language models and state space models. I hold both a Masterâ€™s and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/). Throughout both my undergraduate and Master's studies, I conducted research on the problem of Continual Learning under the supervision of [Dr. Linh Ngo Van](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tZ78MoQAAAAJ) and [Associate Prof. Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/). Since August 2023, I have had the privilege of working under the supervision of [Professor Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) and [Professor Hongkai Wen](https://hongkaiw.github.io/). Under their guidance, I have conducted research on Pruning at Initialization (PaI) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS), developing a differentiable algorithm to address the discrete optimization challenges inherent in both problems.
